<h2><b>QUANTEST intrigues the specialists...</b></h2>
<p>Of course the QUANTEST solution intrigues the specialists of the sector. The personality tests inspired by RORSCHACH have conditioned the psychologists of the work to be satisfied with difficult evaluations, riddled with bias. Psychologically inspired methodologies, all in general, compel professional recruiters to invest more time to overcome the artifice contained in the CVs rather than to quickly judge the adequacy between the profile of the candidate and the requirements of the position to be filled.</p>
<p>On the one hand, on the margins and within organizations that are working to facilitate access to employment, there is a proliferation of CV manufacturing techniques. On the other hand, books and online courses prepare to pass tests in the manner of the test for the driving license. Faced with these realities, the personality test invented by Hermann RORSCHACH (1884-1922) more than a century ago is well damaged. It evolved by its editorial forms but its limits of investigation remained in all their totality or almost.</p>

<p>The limits of QUANTEST are essentially ethical. The method is a mix of single-use vectors developed for each specific test. They simulate the presence of subjects and criteria to be tested. The result of the test is the comparative measurement between standard criteria and their corresponding in the subject under test. The variations are noted and then interpreted by the algorithms that compile the individual results sheets.</p>
